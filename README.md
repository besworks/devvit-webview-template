# Devvit (Experimental) WebView Template

A barebones JS only webview app template. Based on the official [Hello World Template](https://github.com/reddit/devvit-hello-world-experimental).

## Sugar Free

- All TypeScript has been stripped out (except **src/devvit/main.ts** which is a hardcoded path).
- API Router example logic simplified. Just a single example route returning username & avatar.
- UI trimmed down. No real moving parts. Only minimal HTML/JS/CSS boilerplate.
- Lean, clean, and to-the-point. Start porting or prototyping quickly. No warranty.

## Usage

This is an unofficial template for an experimental [Devvit](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/) feature that is still in active development. The most up-to-date usage instructions and known details are being tracked in [this article](https://dev.to/besworks/experimental-devvit-web-views-5c15).
